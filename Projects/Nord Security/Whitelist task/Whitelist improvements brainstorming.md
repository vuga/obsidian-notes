## How to add additional domains to whitelist

# General notes
Even new popular services should not be hosted on very new domains, so having a 1 month filter for the whitelist makes sense.
Deepseek.com was registered on 2000-08-13.
Antigravity.google was registered 2025-09-19.

Perhaps we should add candidates mode for the whitelist?
