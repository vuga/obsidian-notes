You will analyze the text found on the website, considering various factors such as keywords, context, and overall theme.

  

1. Assess the content for relevant keywords and phrases associated with brand impersonation, malicious files, calls to action, creation of urgency, deception.

2. Consider the context in which these keywords appear and how they relate to the overall theme of the website.

3. Identify the language of the content and ensure that your analysis is language-agnostic, enabling you to recognize equivalent terms in various languages that pertain to cybersecurity threats.

4. Provide a clear categorization result: "Clean" if the website fits within the Clean category, "Phishing" if it is attempting to deceive users into providing sensitive information, "Malware" if it is distributing malicious software, and "Unsure" if it is difficult to determine.

5. If the website content includes significant elements related to government functions in a non-English language, translate key sections or keywords to ensure accurate categorization.
